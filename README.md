## **•Team Members:**<br/>
Parnian Habibi, Daniel Bae, Anh Nguyen, and Luis Usseglio.

## **•High Level Overview:**<br/>
A web application that pulls in transaction details (we will provide sample data) and allows the user to set alerts/business rules and receive notifications around them.  The system should also save data to a database so recurring reports can be created.

## **•Requirements:**<br/>
1.	Must be a web application built in a “newer” web development framework
a.	.Net preferably – if you choose another framework, support from us will be limited
2.	Client side framework/libraries are up to you but must be included in project (aka no external resources)
3.	Database should preferably be in SQL server 2012 or above – if you choose another database option, support from us will be limited.
4.	Home Page
a.	Transaction list sorted by date
i.	Don’t need to worry about searching/filtering
b.	Ability to export transactions
5.	Alerts - Tool should allow for configurable business rules to be created to alert user when transactions fit into a set of criteria.
a.	Users should be able to Add/Edit/Delete business rules without technical assistance.
b.	These are examples (you have the liberty of coming up with what types of business rules there are and how they are implemented): 
i.	Minimum of 3 business rules added to system
1.	Ex: Out of state transactions
2.	Ex: Timeframe usage
3.	Ex: Categories
6.	Notifications based on Business Rules
a.	Main Requirement: Notification when the user logs in
i.	Ex: Transaction in Alaska
ii.	Ex: Transaction at 2AM
iii.	Ex: Transaction from Spa
b.	Stretch Goal: Messaging center in the app
i.	Up to your team how to implement this
c.	Stretchier Goal: Notifications via email or text message
i.	Up to your team how to implement this
7.	Reporting 
a.	Dashboard:
i.	Number of times each alert has been tripped over the past month and year
1.	Daily screen should be easy to read, easy to use, and provide a snapshot of data
ii.	Ability to hide alerts where the times tripped is zero
b.	Ability to pull/compare business rule different timeframes
c.	Ability to export to spreadsheet

## **•Stretch Goals:**<br/>
1.	Unit testing
2.	Deploy the project into a windows server/cloud instance
a.	Practice configuration properties for different environments
3.	Use a front-end Framework (Decide from beginning)
4.	Create a Web API layer for backend interactions. 
5.	Use an open source reporting tool/business intelligence suite for all the reporting and its data visualization
6.	Use version control throughout the project
7.	Security scan your application. OWASP ZAP is a good open source option.

## **•During final presentation, we would like to see the following:**<br/>
-	 Working application:<br/>
 o	 Home Page<br/>
 o   Ability to set up business rules<br/>
 o	 Alerts trigger when transactions are added and fit criteria<br/>
 o	 Notifications<br/>
 o	 Reporting<br/>
 
-	Takeaways:<br/>
 o	 Did you learn anything new?<br/>
 o	 Did you experience any setbacks?<br/>
 o   What did you do to overcome them?<br/>
 o	 Suggestions for future projects<br/>

## **•Suggestions:**<br/>
 •   Ask questions when you don’t understand something.<br/>
 •   Feel free to modify the project data we send to fit your needs.<br/>
 •   Start early. Things that don’t seem like they’ll take long usually do.<br/>
 •	 Split the work. One person shouldn’t be doing everything.<br/>
 •	 Keep it simple. Less is more sometimes.<br/>
 •	 The ol’ “Most of all, have fun” bullet-point.<br/>
